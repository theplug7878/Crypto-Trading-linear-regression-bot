# Crypto-Trading-linear-regression-bot

This repository contains a Python script that interfaces with the Coinbase exchange via CCXT to fetch order book and historical price data for a cryptocurrency pair (e.g., ETH/USD). It identifies stop-loss/liquidity clusters, predicts price direction using linear regression, and visualizes bid/ask volume clusters with Matplotlib in real time
